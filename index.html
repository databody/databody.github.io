<p><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> Building body knowledge is a multi-disciplinary, interpersonal endeavor that implicates medical imaging capabilities, scientific institutions, and datafication of personhood in popular culture. Drawing on existing scholarship in critical digital health studies, we contribute an articulation of how self-tracking leads to a paradox of control: the motivation to extend body knowledge is complicated by the experience of available consumer tools. Self-tracking as a mechanism of biopower underpins the paradox of control and contextualizes the subversive or resistant aims of the proposed resolutions. Prior work has suggested paths of subversion and resistance through available consumer technologies, as well as critique of how these technologies are designed. Our work focuses on relating biotechnologically mediated art to the use of self-tracking tools more generally. This paper is intended for both artists working with biological data or matter, and consumers of self-tracking technology who are interested in adapting these tools as creative means for building body knowledge. We turn to contemporary artworks constructed using biological material or bodily observation to find a resolution to the paradox of control, which includes (1) renegotiating the relationship to institutions, (2) mobilizing available tools for unconventional narratives, and (3) embracing biological material.</small></p>

  <h2>Teaching</h2>
  Since 2020, we have taught courses at Berlin's School of Machines, Making and Make-Believe about seeing the body.
  <h3>Radical Imperfection in Time-Tracking</h3>
  <p>Feb-Mar 2021, taught by Kit. We use collection, analysis, and exploration of personal data as a site of institutional and cultural phenomena, reviewing topics in self-improvement ethos and biopower and the gendered valuation of labor. We apply each of the Data Feminism principles, and the fundamental information visualization techniques, to working with our own data about time (including, but not limited to, time spent in various creative pursuits.) Through expressive, artistic sketches of our own data, we dismantle the presumed/supposed neutrality and precision of data - especially data collected by technologies employing rhetorics of objectivity.</p>
  <h3>Radical Imperfection in Self-Tracking</h3>
  <p>Nov-Dec 2020, taught by Kit. Critical perspectives on self-tracking through sensors and wearables, and collaborative exploration of ways to reconfigure technology for sustainable and transformative systematic reflection practices. We covered technologies involved in tracking of sleep, movement, and emotion/mood - all of which pose distinct challenges. (More materials about the courses <a href=https://www.are.na/kit-kuksenok/radical-imperfection>here</a>.)</p>
  <h3>Medical Bodies</h3>
  <p>Apr-May 2020; and Sep-Oct, 2020. Taught by Marisa. What do art and medicine have in common? How can an investigation of the inner-workings of our bodies and it's depictions in early art/anatomy/medicine dialogues inform our view of the current state of the world, our own art practice, and our selves?</p>

  <p>The work of contemporary visual artists demonstrate the interdisciplinary exchange between artists and scientists. How did the adoption of new technologies and scientific methods in visual art reintroduce the subject of self and the human body? How does visual- and Sci art help us to learn more about ourselves and how our bodies react to outside stimuli? Weekly assignments will invited online class participants into an exciting journey of self discovery through the investigation of intersections in visual arts and science.</p>
