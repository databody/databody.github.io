  <h2>Past Courses</h2>
  Since 2020, we have taught courses at Berlin's School of Machines, Making and Make-Believe about seeing the body.
  <h3>Radical Imperfection in Time-Tracking</h3>
  <p>Feb-Mar 2021, taught by Kit. We use collection, analysis, and exploration of personal data as a site of institutional and cultural phenomena, reviewing topics in self-improvement ethos and biopower and the gendered valuation of labor. We apply each of the Data Feminism principles, and the fundamental information visualization techniques, to working with our own data about time (including, but not limited to, time spent in various creative pursuits.) Through expressive, artistic sketches of our own data, we dismantle the presumed/supposed neutrality and precision of data - especially data collected by technologies employing rhetorics of objectivity.</p>
  <h3>Radical Imperfection in Self-Tracking</h3>
  <p>Nov-Dec 2020, taught by Kit. Critical perspectives on self-tracking through sensors and wearables, and collaborative exploration of ways to reconfigure technology for sustainable and transformative systematic reflection practices. We covered technologies involved in tracking of sleep, movement, and emotion/mood - all of which pose distinct challenges. (More materials about the courses <a href=https://www.are.na/kit-kuksenok/radical-imperfection>here</a>.)</p>
  <h3>Medical Bodies</h3>
  <p>Apr-May 2020; and Sep-Oct, 2020. Taught by Marisa. What do art and medicine have in common? How can an investigation of the inner-workings of our bodies and it's depictions in early art/anatomy/medicine dialogues inform our view of the current state of the world, our own art practice, and our selves?</p>

  <p>The work of contemporary visual artists demonstrate the interdisciplinary exchange between artists and scientists. How did the adoption of new technologies and scientific methods in visual art reintroduce the subject of self and the human body? How does visual- and Sci art help us to learn more about ourselves and how our bodies react to outside stimuli? Weekly assignments will invited online class participants into an exciting journey of self discovery through the investigation of intersections in visual arts and science.</p>
